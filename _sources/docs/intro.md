## Welcome to the PARADIM Jupyter Book

This documentation is built collaboratively by PARADIM staff, trainees, and users contribute content describing their work.
The site leverages [Jupyter Book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book) allowing teams to use MarkDown or Jupyter Notebooks to create content shared here.
