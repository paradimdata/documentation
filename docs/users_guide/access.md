* [Managing groups](manage-groups) 
* [Managing permissions](manage-permissions)

(manage-users)=
## Users

While it is recommended that users create their own accounts by [registering
using their institutional login](signing-in), it is also possible to create
accounts for users. Note that this will require users to manage a separate
password for their account


Select the **Users** tab then the **Create user** button:

```{figure} images/htmdec-create-user-button.png
---
name: dms-create-user-button
---
```

This will open the **Create new user** window:

```{figure} images/htmdec-create-user.png
---
name: dms-create-user
---
```

Enter the user's information (including password) and select the **Register**
button to create the account.


(manage-groups)=
## Groups

Groups provide an easy way to manage access to resources for multiple users. 

To create a new group, select the **Groups** tab then the **Create group**
button:

```{figure} images/htmdec-create-group.png
---
name: dms-create-group
---
```

This will open the **Create group** window:

```{figure} images/htmdec-create-group-modal.png
---
name: dms-create-group-modal
---
```

From here you can specify the **name** and **description** of the group as well
as whether it is **public** or **private**. Select the **Create** button to
create the group.

(manage-permissions)=
## Managing Permissions

Once you have created users and groups, you can manage permissions on
collections, folders, and files by selecting the **Access control** lock icon.

```{figure} images/htmdec-access-control-button.png
---
name: dms-access-control-button
---
```

This will open the **Access control** window for the selected item:

```{figure} images/htmdec-access-control.png
---
name: dms-access-control
---
```

From here you can select whether the item is **private** or **public** and
manage permissions for groups and users.
