## Welcome to the IMQCAM Jupyter Book

This documentation will be built collaboratively with each task contributing content describing their work.
The site leverages [Jupyter Book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book) allowing teams to use MarkDown or Jupyter Notebooks to create content shared here.  This initial example shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
For more details about Jupyter Books check out
[the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) and standby for instructions on how to contribute during an upcoming BZM.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
